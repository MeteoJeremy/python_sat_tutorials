# Chapter 1 - Python for Earth Sciences
## <u>[Image of globe data]</u>
__Objective:__ Introduce the characteristics and advantages of using Python in Earth Sciences

***
__Note:__ This in __not__ a tutorial for learning Python - there are many resources for that (bellow). In these tutorials we will learn the necessary Python tools required to work with satellite data.

__Python__ is a programming language that has reach a developing level that provides many advantages for Eartch Sciece applications:

- It is __Open Source__: it is free, everybody can use it, everybody can contribute to it
- It is used by an enourmous community of developers
- It is __Modular__: it has all the libraries *(collection of programs or functions for a specific purpose)* you could possibly need; you do not need to install them all

## This means many modules and libraries have been developed by and for *(earth)* scientists 

# Python Ecosystem

Python modules and data structures that make it ideal for earth sciences

there are different ways to program in python (or interact with python). here we are and will be using Jupyter lab interface for these tutorials - next tutorial to get the basics of it (link). 
other options:67

Different ways to run these tutorials (maybe in the readme too)

# Resources

To learn python resources: basic python

If you decide to install and rund these tutorials in your own computer

Installation and usage (including the cloud)

- update figure to include cloud
- conda (links too)

here it needs more links or refer to another file with instructions and resources

Github link and how to get these tutorials

(new files: how to install python (using conda), and a github one)
