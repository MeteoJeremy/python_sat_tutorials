If you decide to install `Python`, there are a number of ways and resources to do so. In here, we will explain how to install Python and Jupyterlab using __conda__, a package manager.

## conda
Conda is a tool that help you install and update Python and any library you might need. Although not only for beginners, conda makes like easier and simplier to install module-built `Python`.

We will use __miniconda__ which is a minimal installer of conda. This means that it install conda, `Python`, packages that they depend on, and only a small number of other packages. The user needs to install any additional packages (libraries) required. This allows your Python installation to be tailored to your needs. 

Additional libraries can be install one by one, or as we will use here, using a list of libraries in a file named __environment.yml__. You can directly download this file from here
