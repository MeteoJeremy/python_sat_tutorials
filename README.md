# python_sat_tutorials
Tutorials to access and process satellite data in the cloud

This project, supported by the Better Scientific Software foundation and NASa, aims to increase accessibility of satellite data & cloud technologies to a broad scientific community through easy-to-follow Python tutorials

Milestone 1 (march 31, 2021)
-	Task 1.1. Update Introduction to Python and Tools chapters, and develop Introduction to JupyterLab chapter and the Satellite data chapter, incorporating new version or advances on the topics, and feedback and learning from teaching and distributing the first version of this tutorial. Release in GitHub repository.
-	Task 1.2. Outline the 3 examples of the Applications Chapters: ocean, land, and atmosphere, where each chapter will be focused on a particular analysis on the topic, from acquiring data to generating figures from analysis results. 
-	Task 1.3. Develop plan to teach tutorials, including potential dates and groups, aiming for one at DOE, one at another US group and another to an international group.

Chapters:
1.	Introduction to Python: Teach basic and necessary Python concepts and commands.
2.	Introduction to Jupyter Lab: Teach basic concepts, commands and use of Jupyter web-based coding notebook interface.
3.	Python Tools: Teaching Python concepts and functions for satellite data analysis. Main concepts: data structures and xarray function, and plotting
4.	Satellite Data Tools: Teaching how to search for satellite data available in the cloud, and read data for specific regions and time periods.
