Tutorial to learn how to access and process Satellite Data using Python and JupyterLab in the Cloud

_Modified from 'Python for Oceanographers' by: Chelle Gentemann and Marisol Garcia-Reyes, link: https://github.com/python4oceanography/ocean_python_tutorial_

### Objective
This tutorial aims to provide scientist who want to use satellite data with the necessary tools for obtaining, analyzing and visualizing these data using, and to so in the Cloud. This project, supported by the Better Scientific Software foundation and NASA, aims to increase accessibility of satellite data & cloud technologies to a broad scientific community through easy-to-follow Python tutorials.

### How it works 
This tutorials are developed to run on the Cloud and access satellite data on the Cloud as well. To launch the tutorials, click on the binder icon here:

This tutorial is divided in Chapters that provide the necessary tools as building blocks. These chapters are stand along, so can be skipped if you are familiar with the particular tool presented. 

The tutorials can also be cloned from this repository, and run locally on your computer (you would need access to the cloud). To get instructions of how to install Python, JupyterLab, clone the tutorials from Github, and to access the data on the cloud, see here: 

## Tutorials timeline

Milestone 1 (March 31, 2021)
-	Task 1.1. Update Introduction to Python and Tools chapters, and develop Introduction to JupyterLab chapter and the Satellite data chapter, incorporating new version or advances on the topics, and feedback and learning from teaching and distributing the first version of this tutorial. Release in GitHub repository.
-	Task 1.2. Outline the 3 examples of the Applications Chapters: ocean, land, and atmosphere, where each chapter will be focused on a particular analysis on the topic, from acquiring data to generating figures from analysis results. 
-	Task 1.3. Develop plan to teach tutorials, including potential dates and groups, aiming for one at DOE, one at another US group and another to an international group.

Chapters:
1.	Introduction to Python: Teach basic and necessary Python concepts and commands.
2.	Introduction to Jupyter Lab: Teach basic concepts, commands and use of Jupyter web-based coding notebook interface.
3.	Python Tools: 
4.	Satellite Data Tools: Teaching how to search for satellite data available in the cloud, and read data for specific regions and time periods.
