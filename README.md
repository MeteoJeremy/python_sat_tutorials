Tutorial to learn how to access and process Satellite Data using Python and JupyterLab in the Cloud

_Modified from 'Python for Oceanographers' by: Chelle Gentemann and Marisol Garcia-Reyes, link: https://github.com/python4oceanography/ocean_python_tutorial_

## Objective
This tutorial aims to provide scientist who want to use satellite data with the necessary tools for obtaining, analyzing and visualizing these data using, and to so in the Cloud. This project, supported by the Better Scientific Software foundation and NASA, aims to increase accessibility of satellite data & cloud technologies to a broad scientific community through easy-to-follow Python tutorial.

## How it works 
<font color=#31909f>__Note:__</font> This in <font color=#31909f>__not__</font> a tutorial on Python per se - there are a myrriad of resources for that. The purpose of this tutorial is to learn, through __examples__, only the necessary Python code and tools required to work with satellite data. We want you to get your toes wet, get to see and use the power of Python, and then maybe you want to learn more. For that, we encourage you to visit the links on the __Resources__ section at the end of each chapter. 

***
This tutorials are developed to run on the Cloud and access satellite data on the Cloud as well (_For this first release, data used is local or available online, the second release will include cloud data access_). To launch the tutorials, click on the binder icon here:

This tutorial is divided in Chapters that provide the necessary tools as building blocks. These chapters are stand along, so can be skipped if you are familiar with the particular tool presented. 

## Chapters:

1. Introduction to Python for Earth Science: basic concepts about Python

2. Introduction to Jupyter Lab: How to use the web interface JupyterLab

3. Python Basics: Basic concepts and features of Python

4a. Python Tools: xarray, the library that makes satellite data analysis easy

4b. Plotting Tools: Python plotting libraries

The tutorials can also be cloned from this repository, and run locally on your computer (you would need access to the cloud). To get instructions of how to install Python, JupyterLab, clone the tutorials from Github, and to access the data on the cloud, see here: __link__
