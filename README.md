# Tutorial: Timeseries of Satellite Data using Python  [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/marisolgr/python_sat_tutorials/main)


Tutorial to learn how to access and analyze time series of Satellite and Satellite-based Data using Python and JupyterLab in the Cloud

## Objective
This tutorial aims to provide scientists who want to use satellite data with the necessary tools for obtaining, temporally analyzing, and visualizing these data using the Cloud. __Note:__ This in __not__ a tutorial on Python per se - there are a myriad of resources for that. The purpose of this tutorial is to learn, through __examples__, only the necessary Python code and tools required to do simple temperal analysis of satellite data. We want you to get your toes wet, get to see and use the power of Python, and then maybe you will want to learn more. For that, we encourage you to visit the links on the __Resources__ section at the end of each chapter. 

This project, supported by the [Better Scientific Software foundation](https://bssw.io/), and originally by [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/), aims to increase accessibility of satellite data and cloud technologies to a broad scientific community through easy-to-follow Python examples.

## How it works 
This tutorial is developed to run __and__ access satellite data on the Cloud. 

__To launch the tutorial__:

- Click on the binder icon below. It will redirect you to an online version of the tutorial. 
- It might take some time to load the first time, but eventually you'll be promted with a _Jupyter_ environment, listing the Chapters of this tutorial, on your web browser (See Chapter 2 for a brief guide on Jupyter Notebook). 
- __Double click__ on the Chapter you want to work on. It will open in a new tab. 
- At the end of the session, quit the session (top right of the page). 
- You can access the tutorial (repeating this same procedure) as many times as you want.

This tutorial is divided into Chapters that provide the necessary tools as building blocks. These chapters are stand-alone, so can be skipped if you are familiar with the particular tool presented. 

## Chapters:

1. Introduction to Python for Earth Science: Basic concepts about Python

2. Introduction to Jupyter Lab: How to use the web interface JupyterLab

3. Python Basics: Basic concepts and features of Python

4a. Python Tools: xarray, the library that makes satellite data analysis easy

4b. Plotting Tools: Python plotting libraries

5. Satellite Cloud Data: Background information on Cloud access and data

6. Ocean Data Example: First cloud data acquisition and analysis on ocean surface temperature data

7. Atmospheric Data Example: Acquisition and analysis of satellite-based data (reanalysis) wind data from the cloud

8. Land Data Example: Acquisition and analysis of vegetation data from online data.

## If you want to run it on your computer
The tutorials can also be cloned from this repository and run locally on your computer (you would need access to the cloud). To get instructions of how to install Python, Jupyter Notebooks, clone the tutorials from Github, and to access the data on the cloud, see [here](https://github.com/marisolgr/python_sat_tutorials/blob/main/Python_Installation.md).
